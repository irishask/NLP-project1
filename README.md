This project was developed by Cecilia Moskovitch & Irena Shtelman Kravitz.

The objective of this project is to build a classifier that can predict whether a piece of news is fake based on its content. 
In our project we used spaCy library for NLP analysis, and different Bag Of Words and Deep Learning NLP models.

The data used for this project was drawn from Kaggle datasets:  https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset.

You can also see the presentation 'Real & Fake news -presentation.pptx'.

IMPORTANT NOTE: 
Because all CSV-files that were created during different stages of the project, as well as 'glove.6B.200d.txt' file that used in DL-Model2 are too large for GitHub, they are not uploaded to the project's folder.

The definition of Fake News:
Fake news is false or misleading information presented as news. It often has the aim of damaging the reputation of a person or entity, or making money through advertising revenue. Once common in print, the prevalence of fake news has increased with the rise of social media. Fake news can reduce the impact of real news by competing with it.

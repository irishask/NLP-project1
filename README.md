The objective of this project is to build a classifier that can predict whether a piece of news is fake or real based on its content. 
NLP analysis was done with spaCy library and different Bag Of Words and Deep Learning NLP models.

The data used for this project was drawn from Kaggle datasets:  https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
Because all CSV-files that were created during different stages of the project, as well as 'glove.6B.200d.txt' file that used in DL-Model2 are too large for GitHub, they are not uploaded to the project's folder.
This project was developed with Cecilia Moskovitch.

The definition of Fake News:
Fake news is false or misleading information presented as news. It often has the aim of damaging the reputation of a person or entity, or making money through advertising revenue. Once common in print, the prevalence of fake news has increased with the rise of social media. Fake news can reduce the impact of real news by competing with it.
